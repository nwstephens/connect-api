### Inputs

```{r}
key <- Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")
server <- Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER")
```

### R version API

```{r}
url <- paste0(server, "__api__/v1/server_settings/r")
config <- httr::add_headers(Authorization = paste("Key", key))
httr::GET(url, config)
```

### Background: API Keys

API Keys are associated with user accounts. They provide roughly the same level of access to RStudio Connect as a user logged in via the browser would have. See section 13.5.1 of the Connect [admin guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/content-management.html#how-this-works-1).
